# 🚂 Railway Announcement Generator (English Version) 📢

## Overview ℹ️
This Python script generates railway station announcements in English MP3 format based on provided data about train details and stations. The announcements are generated by merging pre-recorded audio snippets with dynamically generated text-to-speech audio.

## Requirements 🛠️
- Python 3.x
- pandas 🐼
- pydub 🔊
- gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) 🗣️

## Installation ⬇️
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install pandas pydub gTTS
    ```

## Usage 🚀
1. Prepare your data in an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) with the following columns:
   - `train_no`: Train number
   - `train_name`: Train name
   - `from`: Departure station
   - `via`: Stations via which the train passes
   - `platform`: Platform number

2. Make sure you have a base audio file named `railway.mp3` located in the `media` directory. This file should contain audio snippets of basic announcements like "May I have attention", "From", "Via", "Is arriving on platform number", and an ending tone.

3. Run the script:
    ```
    python railway_announcement.py
    ```

4. The script will generate the announcement MP3 files for each train based on the provided data.

## Functionality ⚙️
- `textToSpeech(text, filename)`: Converts text to speech and saves it as an MP3 file.
- `mergeAudios(audios)`: Merges multiple MP3 files into a single MP3 file.
- `generateSkeleton()`: Generates the base audio snippets required for announcements.
- `generateAnnouncement(filename)`: Reads data from an Excel file and generates announcements for each train.

## Notes 📝
- Make sure to provide the correct filename of the Excel spreadsheet containing train data in the `generateAnnouncement` function call.
- Ensure that the pre-recorded base audio file (`railway.mp3`) is properly segmented and contains clear audio snippets for seamless merging.
